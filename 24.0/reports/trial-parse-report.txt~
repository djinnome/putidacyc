;;;      ---  Trial Parse Results for Pseudomonas putida KT2440  ---
;;;
;;; This report summarizes the findings of the PathoLogic parser for
;;; annotation files selected by the user for trial parsing.  Through
;;; inspection of this report, the user can tell whether features of major 
;;; importance were not recognized, possibly due to syntax errors or other
;;; problems in the annotation files.
;;;
;;; If you want to change annotation file(s) to improve their parsability, 
;;; update the files and re-run the Trial Parse command.
